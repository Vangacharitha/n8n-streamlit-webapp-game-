# 🚀 AI-Powered App & Game Generator (Streamlit + n8n)

This project is an AI-powered App & Game Generator that creates unique ideas, descriptions, features, and concepts instantly — all inside a clean **Streamlit UI**, fully automated using **n8n workflows**.  

Most idea-generation tools require switching between multiple platforms, manual brainstorming, or complex backend setups. With **Streamlit + n8n**, the entire process becomes simple, fast, and 100% automated.
